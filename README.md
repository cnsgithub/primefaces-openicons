# PrimeFaces-Openicons

Drop-In CSS to have scalable and nice-looking fonts for PrimeFaces (https://www.primefaces.org/) on the default and non-paid theme.

## Additionl information

A request to add this to the regular PrimeFaces build has been discussed in this issue (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/3233), however unfortunately a merge has been rejected due to this being a 'premium' feature.

### Prerequisites

- PrimeFaces 6.1+
- Using Aristo or Omega Theme

### Installing

Copy the following files to your project as additional CSS link:

- primefaces-open-icons-font.css
- Either primefaces-open-icons-omega.css or primefaces-open-icons-omega.css depending on the theme you are using.

It is recommended to copy also the font files referenced in the *-font.css to your local server to avoid being dependent to the CDN.
